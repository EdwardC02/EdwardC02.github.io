    <p>
        As has become evident, especially over recent years, electricity grids are a high value target for state and non-state actors
        who wise to gain money or political goals. To counter this threat, people with knowledge in cyber security are critial in any company
        involved in that field. I have completed multiple subjects in the area of cyber security, that have taught me skills relevent to securing 
        networks, from threats via both physical ports and via online sources, in both malicious software and social engineering. 
        I also have some skills in the area of pentesting, including the use of probing and hacking software on kali linux.
