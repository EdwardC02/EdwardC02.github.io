    <p>
        Being able to work as part of a team is crucial in all areas of the software industry. Throughout university I have developed skills in working collaboratively 
        in a team to complete assessments. One example of this, which, while unrelated to solar panels, helped me to develop my ability to work in a team, is for a game 
        development project where, as a team of three, we developed a game over the course of a year. It required extensive communication to ensure that all the 
        assets were created and working in levels to meet the assessment deadlines.
